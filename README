OVERVIEW
========

Java uses Resource Bundles for i18n stuff.

Here's a typical bundle:

    lang.properties
    ---------------

    key1 = value1
    key2 = value2
    multiline = Line 1\
                Line 2\
                Line 3


Non-ASCII symbols are encoded as Unicode Entities:

    russian_letter_ya = \u044F

See more info on Jva properties files at
http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/docs/api/java/util/Properties.html#load(java.io.InputStream)


rberl will try to bring Resourse Bundles' functionality (most of it anyway) to Erlang

GETTING STARTED
===============

1. Compile rberl.erl from src folder
2. run rberl:get/0 (testing purposes) or rberl:get/1 to get a proplist
   containing all key-value pairs from the specified file


CURRENT FEATURES
===============

1. Parses .properties files into key-value pairs
2. Both keys and values are strings (lists)
3. Parses multiline values
4. Parses unicode values in the form \uxxxx
5. Handles single line comments and empty lines (skips them)


TESTS
=====
The tests were created using the ABNF generator from 
http://www.quut.com/abnfgen/

See the ABNF for Java properties file in priv/properties.abnf

The ABNF does no define a correct properties file, however. Here's a properties file that conforms to the abnf-file:

------- start sample properties file ----------

key = value
key2 : value2
key3 value3
key4 = a multiline\
       value
an_invaild_line

-------- end sample properties file ------------

The purpose is to create a parser that will process such a file and simply 
skip over invalid lines as if they were comments

Test results have been coded by hand, so there are bound to be errors

REQUIREMENTS
============

Should run on R12B or later

Specific modules:
unicode, http://erlang.org/doc/man/unicode.html
re, http://erlang.org/doc/man/re.html

TODO
====

1. Add persistence and key/value lookup
2. Resolve locales for files (for locale "ru_RU_UNIX" go back to   
   *_ru.properties if not found) (see
   http://java.sun.com/docs/books/tutorial/i18n/resbundle/concept.html)
3. Basic formatting and parameter substituion
   (see http://java.sun.com/docs/books/tutorial/i18n/format/index.html,
   http://java.sun.com/docs/books/tutorial/i18n/format/messageintro.html)
